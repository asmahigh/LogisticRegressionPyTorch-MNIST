# LogisticRegressionPyTorch-MNIST
 
Building a logistic regression model in PyTorch to do handwritten digit classification.

### MNIST Dataset
The MNIST dataset is very popular machine learning dataset, consisting of 70000 grayscale images of handwritten digits, of dimensions 28x28.

We split the dataset into two separate groups:

Number of MNIST training examples: 60000

Number of MNIST test examples: 10000

### Goal
So, the goal is to predict which digit is in each image in the testing set. Then, we compute an accuracy by seeing how many we got correct!
